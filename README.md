### Hello World!
I am a professional puzzle-solver. 

For the past 5 years, I have enjoyed the simple challenge of assembling jigsaw puzzles. I love starting with a thousand random pieces and slowly assembling them into something recognizable. I have loved every second of putting together more than a total of 20,000 puzzle pieces, but putting together puzzles is not a career.

A couple of years ago, I ended up in an introductory programming class, and my world changed. My passion rapidly grew as I constructed my first HTML webpage. I loved having the power to shape and transform something until it matches my envisioned design. Programming amplifies all the aspects of puzzles that I love: assembling an amazing product from many smaller (sometimes seemingly unrelated) pieces.

If there is a way to optimize my code, I will do it. There is something so relaxing about continuously testing code and watching minor changes shine through in each version. I see each improvement as if it were a puzzle piece and leaving one out doesnâ€™t do the picture justice. I never leave a program unfinished.

As an undergraduate student, I have not yet decided where I want to take my career within computer science. I am excited to learn how businesses use technology to solve their problems, and to be part of that process.

I'm currently developing my machine learning skills in the context of neuroimaging. I am getting familiar with all of the mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, statistics) that is related to machine learning and attempting to understand the logic behind common machine learning algorithms.
